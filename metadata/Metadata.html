        <p>Many different sources go on and on about how pets are good for you, but I will get straight to the point. Pets all around are good for your health. Not just animals you can pet but all animals, even fish! Watching fish swim can calmn your tense muscles in your body. It is a proven fact that pets lower stress and depression. When you pet/stroke your dog or cat it immediately lowers your blood pressure and calms you down. Playing with your pet increases the levels of the feel-good chemicals serotonin and dopamine in your brain, making your feel better and happier.</p>
